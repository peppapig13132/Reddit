            "body": "\nWarhammer 40,000 is a setting. It is a world, a universe, or an environment in which the various events of the \u201cgrimdark future\u201d take place. It is a time and place, with defined boundaries, conventions, and norms, and the various characters and agents undertake actions within it. It is the stage upon which numerous dramas are enacted - where heroes rise and fall, where armies clash, and where ideological groups vie for supremacy in endless conflict.\n\nWarhammer 40,000 is not a story; it is a universe which\u00a0contains\u00a0and\u00a0facilitates\u00a0stories. It is the world in which stories happen, not the story itself. A theatre is not a play, and a universe is not a story. 40k - as a setting - informs the stories which take place within it, but is not overall moved by them. No matter the conflicts that happen, or the stories that resolve, the status quo of 40k remains fundamentally unchanged:\n\nThe Imperium is a stagnant monolith which echoes former glory.\n\nThe ancient Eldar cling to the remnants of their advanced civilisation.\n\nThe Tau are vibrant upstarts facing an uncertain future.\n\nChaos is a nightmare constantly on the verge of becoming real.\n\nThe Orks are an anarchic force of nature.\n\nThe Necrons are the sleeping giant which begins to wake.\n\nThe Tyranids are the encroaching tempest which is just starting to be felt.\n\nThis is the stage against which every 40k story is set. All events which happened prior Warhammer 40,000\u2019s \u201cpresent day\u201d serve to inform the setting as it has always existed. The War in Heaven, the Fall of the Eldar, the Horus Heresy, the Spheres of Expansion, the Age of Apostasy, the Black Crusades, the Badab Wars\u2026 all of these events are contributors to the nature of 40k as we understand it. They do not alter the setting, but form and strengthen the foundations of it.\n\nPrior to the end of 7th Edition, a lot of impetuous 40k fans were clamouring for Games Workshop to \u201cadd to the 40k story\u201d - to push Warhammer 40,000 out of M41, to see the conclusion of the 13th Black Crusade, and so on. While i can understand this desire - we all love \u201cmore Warhammer\u201d - i believe that it was fundamentally misguided. The core essence of \u201cWhat Makes 40k\u201d is that everything is poised at \u201cOne Minute to Midnight\u201d - Chaos is on the verge of gaining a foothold in realspace, the Necrons begin to awaken, the lost Primarchs may soon return, the Golden Throne is failing, the Orks stand to unify into the strongest Waaagh! ever, Ynnead threatens to awaken and defeat Chaos, and the Tyranids close in on the galaxy from both sides\u2026 all while endless petty conflicts are fought in the shadow of - and yet are informed by - these titanic circumstances.\n\nThese potential events - events which would inevitably overturn the paradigm of the 41st millennium - are \u201ctime-locked\u201d by the 40k setting permanently resting on a knife edge. The essence of 40k is a freeze-frame snapshot taken immediately before an unknown, but impending, eruption in a desolated world. Because 40k is the setting for a wargame, every faction needs to hold hypothetical leverage over the others; if one army had no such leverage - no ancient heroes poised to return, no extra-galactic reinforcements, no vigour of innovation - then nobody would find their conflicts compelling. Almost every faction is simultaneously doomed yet about to play their winning hand, to one degree or another. This is why people find Warhammer exciting.\n\nBy \u201cmoving the 40k plot forward\u201d, this delicate balance is upset. The spell is broken, and things fall out of place. The paradigm of the setting is disrupted, and so 40k is inevitably changed. This means that, no matter how well writers might convey the unfolding of these events, the \u201cmagic\u201d is no longer there. When pieces are moved, the whole crumbles, and one cannot arrange the broken parts into something as beautiful as what was there before.\n\nThis is why so many people find the events of the Gathering Storm, and all the plot points which occur after those books take place, so disappointing. The reappearance of Guilliman, the Fall of Cadia, the Primaris Marines, the formation of the Ynnari, the Great Rift\u2026 all of these events were broadly met with a general \u201ceh\u201d by the fans. In particular, the relatively minor events detailed within these books - such as the Desolation of Armageddon, the Battle of Biel-tan, and the completion of Kheradruakh\u2019s skull collection - became the object of particular fan backlash. These events, decades in the making, were simply glossed over for the sake of covering ground, even though lesser events had previously earned themselves anthologies of novels and rule supplements. In short, the new story was not being treated with the reverence it deserved. This was less because of bad writing, but because - when moving one piece also moves every other piece in the galaxy - it is simply not possible to do justice to every single moving piece in the space of a few books. \u201cDoing the Gathering Storm well\u201d was a task doomed to failure from the outset.\n\nIn particular, the balance of power - once delicately established and generally \u201copen season\u201d for all factions - was completely unsalvageable. With the return of Guilliman and the creation of a brand new army of \u201cSuper Space Marines\u201d, the stagnant nature of the Imperium effectively evaporated. The Imperium had only regressed into its current \u201cGrimdark\u201d state due to the absence of world-moving figures such as the Primarchs and the Emperor, and the return of one such figure inevitably erased much of that which characterised the Imperium in the first place. The resulting \u201cNew Imperium\u201d is a more tonally optimistic and smoothed-out entity, lacking much of the gothic, worn-out grittiness which made it such a stand-out presence in fiction in the first place.\n\nAlthough the writers attempted to remedy this by bringing back the \u201cChaos Rift\u201d concept from the Horus Heresy, it doesn\u2019t work here. For the return of Guilliman and the introduction of the Primaris Marines to be worthwhile (which it must, else neither justifies their presence in the story), they must either dominate the landscape or fail spectacularly. Since narrative failure wouldn\u2019t sell models, Games Workshop had to write it so that Guilliman and his new forces were disproportionately successful, even against the ostensibly-resurgent Chaos forces. This makes Chaos look ineffectual and cartoonish, and the Imperium seem momentous and progressive. This is the opposite of how both factions are supposed to be portrayed, and it\u2019s why so many long-standing fans are angry at this self-evident \u201cchange of direction\u201d. They consider it a betrayal of the source material\u2026 because that\u2019s exactly what it is.\n\nI say again that Warhammer 40,000 is a setting; it is the universe in which stories take place, and not a story in its own right. The whole might be informed by its parts, but the whole itself cannot be treated as a part. A clock is not a gear, a body is not an organ, a stage is not a drama, and Warhammer 40,000 is not a story. To coin a phrase, trying to update \u201c40k\u2019s story\u201d is\u00a0not\u00a0like trying to change a part inside a car: It\u2019s like trying to replace the entire car with a subtly different, and perhaps sleeker, one. The superficial differences between the two may appear to be minor, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that none of the original survived the transition. Those who liked the old car won\u2019t forgive you for getting rid of that thing they loved, and fans of the new car are perplexed about why people are so sad about that \u201cold hunk of junk\u201d being disposed of. Fandom division ensues.\n\nThe way to \u201cadd to\u201d 40k is to flesh out the world which already exists. That is, you create more stories and concepts\u00a0within\u00a0it - past and present. Adding more stories doesn\u2019t change the overall structure of 40k as a setting, but reveals more detail about what makes the setting what it is. Unearthing the remains of an ancient city does not change the city itself, but the appearance of freshness is there because more of what exists is progressively revealed. More detail is added to our understanding of an unchanging whole. That is what Warhammer has thrived on for decades, and it\u2019s a recipe for success. For instance, even disappointing entries into the canon - while bad - have only a limited impact on the universe as a whole. However, this is not true of the recent additions to the lore, which\u00a0do\u00a0fundamentally affect the nature of the entire 40k universe. If you don\u2019t like the changes - and many don\u2019t - then you suddenly start thinking less of \u201cmodern 40k\u201d as a whole. Fandom division continues.\n\nThis is not unique to Warhammer 40,000 by any means. Many fans of Star Wars have recently been disappointed with Disney\u2019s recent Sequel Trilogy for similar reasons. Dejected fans of Star Trek were only placated by the fact that the recent \u201creboot\u201d films and TV spin-offs were officially declared non-canon in relation to the original TV shows. A lot of Harry Potter fans wish to dissociate from Fantastic Beasts and The Cursed Child. The list goes on. Although all of these franchises use fictional worlds as their setting, the stories themselves are mated to said settings on a fundamental level. The story is the propeller on the plane that is the setting; as the plot moves forward, the setting changes with it. This allows for climactic conclusions such as the destruction of the second Death Star and the Battle of Hogwarts, which fundamentally shape the settings they are a part of\u2026 but the same is not true of 40k.",
